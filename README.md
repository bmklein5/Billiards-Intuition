This repository serves as a home for the WebPPL model create by MIT computer science students Ethan Ardolino, Brady Klein, and Bennett Stankovits. This model analyzes the performance of Billiards players over various table states in an online, graphical environment with their confidence in their ability to make these on an actual pool table.
